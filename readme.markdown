# HTML5 Games Example

This project is an example project that shows how to integrate Universal Uclick's HTML5 Games in an iOS `UIWebView`.

## To get this running

Make a copy of the file located inside `HTMLGamesExample/Secrets.plist.example`, and name it `Secrets.plist`. This file should reside at...

    HTMLGamesExample/Secrets.plist

Open the project in Xcode and make sure to plug your Universal Uclick Client ID and Authorization Key in the `Secrets.plist` file. Then just build and run!

## In detail

More detail coming soon about how the game is loaded in `UUDetailViewController`.
